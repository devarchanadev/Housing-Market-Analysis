## 🔍 Insights and Recommendations

### 🛠 Why These Tools Were Used

- **Association Rule Mining**: To uncover hidden patterns in the housing data, revealing relationships between different factors such as **income levels**, **ocean proximity**, and **housing prices**.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Ensures accurate and reliable findings by converting raw data into a usable format.

### 🔑 Key Insights

- **Proximity to Ocean**: Higher budgets are more likely to find homes closer to the ocean, particularly in the "<1H OCEAN" category.
- **Population Density**: Low and very low population areas are strongly associated with older housing, regardless of income level.

### 📝 Recommendations

| Budget Range          | Recommendation                                                   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 💸 **<112k**          | Focus on inland areas where homes are more affordable.            |
| 💵 **209k and above** | Target areas closer to the ocean for a balance of price and location. |
